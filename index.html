    <p>
      Shortbread or shortie is a traditional Scottish biscuit usually made from
      one part white sugar, two parts butter and three to four parts plain wheat
      flour. Shortbread does not contain any leavening, such as baking powder or
      baking soda. Shortbread is widely associated with Christmas and Hogmanay
      festivities in Scotland, and some Scottish brands are exported around the
      world.
